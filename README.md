## 📃 Project Summary:

This project aims to explore the global entertainment landscape using the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. By conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns and trends related to content types, genre preferences, rating distributions, content duration, and country-wise contributions.

The analysis uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and covers univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations. We focus on business-impacting insights such as dominant genres, localized content trends, and shifts in content release patterns over time.

The end goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance content strategy, improve viewer engagement, and explore potential markets for Netflix content.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Netflix, being one of the largest OTT platforms globally, continuously updates its content library. However, understanding what kind of content performs well, what genres are oversaturated, and how content differs by region remains a challenge.

**How can we use EDA to understand Netflix’s global content strategy and viewer preferences?**

## 🎯 Business Objective

- Identify trends in genre popularity and content type.
- Examine country-wise contributions to Netflix’s library.
